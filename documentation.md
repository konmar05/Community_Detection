# Community Detection

### 1 - What is important

#### 1.1 Definition

What is a community? A group of verticies such that verticies inside the group 
connected with many more edges than between groups. 

Density of edges - Compactness - Frequency of ties

difference to clustering? AI?

#### 1.2 Density

Graph density, internal density, external edges density,

#### 1.3 Modularity

Modularity score? to indetify community structures. to compare communities. 
The higher modularity score - the better are communities.

#### 1.4 Edges and Nodes

Basic attributes in every network or graph

#### 1.5 Multiple Solutions

It does not exist the one and only correct solutions. Each algorithm could have a different resut.

#### 1.6 Overlapping/Nonoverlapping communities

### 2 - Detection Techniques

#### 2.1 Agglomerative Methods

#### 2.2 Divisive Methods

### 3 - Different Algorithms

#### 3.1 Graph partitioning

recursive graph partitioning is the way to do community detection. to get smaller pieces/subcommunities. increasing 
submodularity. some graph partitioning algorithms:

- metis
- fiduccia-mattheyses
- kernighan-lin
- spectral partitioning
- multilevel partitioning
- recursive bisection
- lable propagation

Graph cut, Ratio cut, Normalized cut, Quotient cut

#### 3.2 Girvan-Newman

uses "edge betweenness"

#### 3.3 Edge betweenness

simliar to graph cuts, cutting edges, node centrality (shortet paths).

#### 3.4 Fast community unfolding

to find parts wit high modularity

#### 3.5 Random walk

walktrap community detection. Random walks on a graph tend to get trapped into densely connected
parts corresponding to communities.

#### 3.6 K-clique community detection

! for overlapping communities !

#### 3.7 Agglomerative hierarchical clustering
